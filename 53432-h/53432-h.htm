<p>Desert Areas of the West&mdash;this booklet deals with the common plants of three
of them: (1) the Chihuahua; (2) the Sonoran; and (3) the Mojave.</p>
<p>Plants of the higher plateau country of from 4,500 to 7,000-feet elevation are
shown and described in &ldquo;Flowers of the Southwest Mesas,&rdquo; companion volume to
this one, by Pauline M. Patraw and Jeanne R. Janish, 1951.</p>
<p>Mountain zone vegetation (from the Ponderosa Pine belt, or about 7,000 feet,
on up) is the subject of &ldquo;Flowers of the Southwest Mountains,&rdquo; the third of the
triad, by Leslie P. Arnberger and Jeanne R. Janish.</p>

<h2 id="c3">HOW TO USE THIS BOOKLET</h2>
<p>In order that you may get full value from this booklet, it is
important that you understand how to make the greatest use of it.
The purpose of the booklet is double: (1) to introduce the common
desert flowers to newcomers to the Southwest; and (2), to give a
little background of information about the plants&rsquo; interesting habits
and how they have been and are used by animals, by the native
peoples, and by the settlers. Every effort has been made to present
accurate, if not always complete, information.</p>
<p>Since there are more than 3,200 plants recorded from Arizona
alone, and this booklet attempts to introduce you to the common
plants of desert areas in Texas, New Mexico, and California in addition
to Arizona, it is apparent that you will find an enormous number
of flowers which are not included. Therefore, a painstaking
effort has been made to select the commonest or most spectacular;
that is, those which you will naturally stop to look at and say,
&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For ease in identification, flowers are arranged in this booklet
according to color of the flower petals. When you meet a flower to
whom you would like an introduction, first note the color of its
petals. Don&rsquo;t jump too quickly to a conclusion, for what at first glance
may seem to be pink, careful examination may prove to be lavender,
violet, or purple. Once you feel reasonably sure of the color,
turn to the section of the booklet in which flowers of that color are
listed and examine the sketches. Find something that looks similar?</p>
<p>Now check the size of the plant as indicated in the sketch and
text. Does the text list the flower as occurring in the particular desert
area (see <a href="#Page_2">map on next page</a>) where you are? Is the blossoming
season correct? Do other details check? If so, the chances are that
you have the right flower&mdash;or at least a close relative. Close enough,
anyway, so that you may be reasonably safe in calling the flower
by its common name. Of course if a botanist happens along, he may
point out that you have <i>Penstemon parryi</i> whereas you thought you
had struck up an acquaintance with <i>Penstemon pseudospectabilis</i>.
However, it&rsquo;s a penstemon, even tho&rsquo; a sister of the one you thought
you were meeting. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll run across a dozen other brothers
and sisters before you happen onto the member of the genus common
enough to be listed specifically in our Desert Who&rsquo;s Who.</p>
<p>Certain of the desert flowers change color with age. Also, during
off seasons, some of the really common flowers don&rsquo;t show up
in large numbers while a few of the rarer ones may take their turn
at brightening up the desert. Furthermore, in a few cases such as
the Oleander, the species comes in two colors, red flowers on one
plant and white on another. The Bird-of-Paradise flower has yellow
petals, but the rest of the flower is red, so it&rsquo;s a toss-up which color
you might call it. The Beavertail Cactus has magenta flowers while
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
those of its very close relative, Engelmann&rsquo;s Prickly Pear, have yellow
blossoms, yet in this booklet it has been necessary to put them
both on the same page in the &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; section.</p>
<p>So, this booklet makes no claims to perfection, and these discrepancies
add certain hazards to the game. You may strike out
several times before getting to first base. As you become accustomed
to using the booklet, home runs will come more frequently,
and you will soon begin to have a lot of fun. If any particular species
especially interests you, once you are certain of its identity you can
readily find out more about it by following up in one or more of the
publications listed in this booklet under the heading &ldquo;<a href="#c9">References</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few of the common desert flowers have been left out of this
booklet&mdash;purposely. The reason is that, although they are well represented
among desert flowers, they are even more common throughout
non-desert parts of the Southwest. You will find them all in a companion
booklet: Polly Patraw&rsquo;s &ldquo;Flowers of the Southwest Mesas.&rdquo;
They belong principally to the following groups: Cottonwood, Rabbit-brush,
Snakeweed, Saltbush, Apacheplume, Clematis, Squawbush,
Blanketflower, Sunflower, Groundsel, Elder, Blazing Star and Morningglory.</p>
<h2 id="c4">PLANT NAMES
<br />Be Serious About Plant Names&mdash;But Not Too Serious</h2>
<p>It has often been said that &ldquo;a rose by any other name would smell
as sweet.&rdquo; Although the statement is literally true, we are often disappointed,
perhaps offended, when we find some flower friend of long
acquaintance called by another, and, to our minds, inferior name. Also,
we dislike the attachment of a name which we have long associated
with a certain plant to another, and perhaps less attractive, flower.</p>
<p>Common names are by no means standardized in their usage,
and a well known plant in one part of the country may be called by
an entirely different name somewhere else. Also, certain names are
applied to a number of plants which more or less resemble one
another. For instance, the name &ldquo;Greasewood&rdquo; is applied to almost
any plant that has oily or highly inflammable leaves; and with the
avid reading by eastern people of Zane Grey&rsquo;s and other &ldquo;westerns,&rdquo;
any shrubby plant with grayish foliage covering large areas of western
land immediately becomes &ldquo;Sagebrush.&rdquo; This is particularly irritating
to inhabitants of the desert areas treated in this booklet because true
Sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>) rarely grows below elevations of 6,000
feet. The loose application of common names is a confusing annoyance
to wildflower enthusiasts.</p>
<p>In an effort to avoid this confusion and to establish a method
of naming that will be uniform throughout the world, botanists have
developed a system using descriptive Latin names and grouping
plants into genera and families based upon their relationships to
one another as determined by their physical structure. Unfortunately
for the layman, this system is so technical and the Latin names so
unintelligible that he becomes completely bewildered. Furthermore,
advanced botanical studies result in continual regroupings and changes
in names so that the amateur botanist finds it impossible to keep up.
Botanists who specialize in plant nomenclature have a tendency to
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
become so involved with the technicalities of naming that their writings
bristle with minute descriptions of anatomical details and the reader
searches in vain for such basic information as a simple statement of the
color of the flowers.</p>
<p>The majority of common flowers have several to many common
names. This is particularly true in the Southwest where some plants
have names in English, Spanish, and one or more Indian languages.
In addition, of course, each species has its scientific name. An effort has
been made in this booklet to give as many of the names applied to
each selected flower as are readily available. This not only aids in
identifying the plant, but adds to its interest. The reader then finds
himself in the enviable position of being able to scan the field and
choose whichever name appeals to him with the reasonable assurance
that he is right&mdash;at least in one locality.</p>
<p>Since this booklet was written by a layman for the use and enjoyment
of other laymen, it violates a number of botanical, or taxonomic,
principles. These violations have been committed with no spirit of
disrespect, but in an effort to avoid confusion, conserve space, and keep
a complicated and involved subject as simple as possible. The writer
believes that the visitor to the desert who has a normal pleasure in
nature is interested in the flowers because of their beauty and their
relationships with other inhabitants of the desert, including mankind.</p>
<h2 id="c5">THE DESERT&mdash;WHAT AND WHERE IS IT?</h2>
<p>In this booklet we are dealing with DESERT flowers, so it seems
logical to take a moment to check upon the desert itself. What is a desert,
and how may we recognize one when we see it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A desert,&rdquo; stated the late Dr. Forrest Shreve, &ldquo;is a region of deficient
and uncertain rainfall.&rdquo; Where moisture is deficient and uncertain, only
such plants survive as are able to endure long periods of extreme
drought. Desert vegetation is, therefore, made up of plants which,
through various specialized body structures, can survive conditions of
severe drought. In general, the deserts of the world are fairly close to the
equator, so they occur in climates that are hot as well as dry. Plants in
the deserts of the Southwest must endure long periods of heat as well
as drought.</p>
<p>In North America, major desert areas are located in the general
vicinity of the international boundary between Mexico and the United
States. Due to various differences in elevation, climatic conditions, and
other factors, certain portions of this Great American Desert favor the
growth of plants of certain types. Based on these general vegetative
types, botanists have catalogued the Great American Desert into four
divisions, as follows (see <a href="#Page_2">map</a>):</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Chihuahuan Desert: Western Texas, southern New Mexico, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Coahuila.</dt>
<dt>2. Sonoran Desert (Arizona Desert): Baja (Lower) California, northern Sonora, and southern Arizona.</dt>
<dt>3. Mohave-Colorado Desert (California Desert): Portions of southern California, southern Nevada, and northwestern Arizona.</dt>
<dt>4. Great Basin Desert: The Great Basin area of Nevada, Utah, and northeastern Arizona.</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>It is of especial interest to note that certain plants such as Creosotebush
(<i>Larrea tridentata</i>) seems to thrive in several of these desert areas
while others are found in great abundance in only one. Plants that grow
in profusion in only one desert are spoken of as &ldquo;indicators&rdquo; of that particular
desert. Any person interested in desert vegetation soon learns the
major indicators, not only of the different deserts, but of different sections
or elevations in the same desert. Here are some of the better-known
indicator plants:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Chihuahuan Desert: Lechuguilla (<i>Agave lechuguilla</i>);</dt>
<dt>2. Sonoran Desert: Saguaro (<i>Carnegiea gigantea</i>);</dt>
<dt>3. Mohave-Colorado Desert: Joshua-tree (<i>Yucca brevifolia</i>);</dt>
<dt>4. Great Basin Desert: Sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>).</dt></dl>
<p>This publication deals with the common plants and flowers of the
Chihuahuan, Sonoran, and Mohave-Colorado Deserts. Since these
names are strange to many visitors to the Southwest, the writer has
taken the liberty of applying descriptive names as synonyms. In this
booklet the Chihuahuan Desert is called the Texas Desert, the Sonoran
Desert is referred to as the Arizona Desert, and the Colorado-Mohave
Desert is considered as the California Desert.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, the desert in which a particular species of plant
is most common is indicated; however, this should not be interpreted
too rigidly as most of the plants in this book grow in more than one
desert and some grow in all.</p>
<p>Because the Great Basin Desert is a region of higher elevation and is
influenced by other factors which are not common to the three portions
of the Great American Desert covered in this booklet, its vegetation is
more like that of the plateaulands and foothills of the Southwest. Therefore,
the flowers of the Great Basin Desert are included in a companion
booklet, Polly Patraw&rsquo;s &ldquo;Flowers of the Southwest Mesas.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c6">NATIONAL PARKS AND MONUMENTS
<br />AS WILDFLOWER SANCTUARIES</h2>
<p>Someone has called National Parks and Monuments &ldquo;The Crown
Jewels of America.&rdquo; A part of their beauty and irreplaceable value is
because the approximately 180 units of the National Park System which
extends from Florida to Alaska and from Hawaii to Maine, are and
have been wildflower sanctuaries. Not only do native plants live under
natural conditions, but they are protected from picking, from grazing of
domestic livestock, and from the competition of exotic species, and from
other activities of mankind that would disrupt their normal habitat or
disturb their native way of life.</p>
<p>Men in the uniform of the National Park Service feel complimented
whenever visitors show an interest in the natural features of the areas
they protect, and are happy to assist them in locating rare species or
especially beautiful or spectacular specimens. Range and grazing
specialists are more and more using the natural vegetation of National
Parks and Monuments as &ldquo;check plots&rdquo; to aid them in studying ways
and means of preserving the level of grazing value on the open ranges.</p>
<p>Within the desert areas of the Southwest there are a number of
National Parks and Monuments. Three Monuments (Joshua Tree in
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
California, Organ Pipe Cactus and Saguaro in Arizona) have been
created primarily to save from exploitation and destruction outstanding
areas of typical desert vegetation. Although the others have been established
to protect and preserve geologic, historic, or archeologic values
of national significance, they are all wildflower sanctuaries. In California,
Death Valley National Monument is outstanding in its variety of desert
flowers. Lake Mead National Recreation Area, of which Hoover Dam
is the center, has exceptional displays of various forms of desert plants.
A great variety of desert vegetation will be shown and, if desired,
explained to the interested visitor, by National Park Service rangers at
Chiricahua, Tonto, Montezuma Castle, Casa Grande, and Tumacacori
National Monuments in Arizona. Of course the really great displays of
desert botany and ecology are featured at Organ Pipe Cactus and
Saguaro National Monuments.</p>
<p>In New Mexico, Chihuahuan Desert vegetation is particularly
abundant at Carlsbad Caverns National Park. A number of desert
forms, especially interesting because of the effect upon them of the ever-moving
gypsum dunes, are found at White Sands National Monument,
near Alamogordo. Another outstanding Chihuahuan Desert wildflower
sanctuary is Big Bend National Park in southwestern Texas.</p>
<p>Photography is encouraged in all of the National Parks and Monuments.
By asking a ranger, you will be able to learn where the various
flower displays may be found, the best time of day to obtain good results,
and other suggestions helpful in obtaining photographs of desert wildflowers
at their very best.</p>
<p>Each year the following magazine and radio program present bulletins
on moisture and other pertinent conditions in the desert, spotlight areas in
which outstanding wildflower displays are developing, and advance suggestions
relative to areas in which spectacular displays may be expected.</p>

<h2 id="c7">DESERT PLANTS</h2>
<p>Many people think of a desert as an area of shifting sand dunes
without vegetation except in areas where springs provide moisture. This
is by no means true of our Southwestern deserts which are characterized
by a rich and diversified plant cover. However, the majority of true
desert plants are equipped by Nature to meet conditions of high temperatures
and deficient and uncertain precipitation. The way in which
desert plants, closely related to common species found growing under
normal temperature and moisture conditions, have adapted themselves
to meet the severe requirements of desert life is truly remarkable and
forms an absorbing and fascinating study.</p>
<p>Shreve groups desert plants into three categories based on the manner
in which they have contrived to conquer the hazards of desert life.</p>
<p>These are:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Drought-escaping plants;</dt>
<dt>2. Drought-evading plants;</dt>
<dt>3. Drought-resisting plants.</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p><i>Drought-escaping</i> plants are the &ldquo;desert quickies,&rdquo; or ephemerals.
Taking advantage of the two seasons of rainfall on the desert (midsummer
showers and midwinter soakers) they develop rapidly, blossom,
and mature their seeds which lie dormant in the soil during the rest of
the year, thus escaping the season of heat and drought. There are two
groups of these &ldquo;quickies,&rdquo; the summer ephemerals and the winter
ephemerals. The former are hot-weather plants; the latter are species
that thrive during the cool, moist weather of winter and early spring.
These &ldquo;quickies&rdquo; present their spectacular floral displays only following
seasons of above-average precipitation.</p>
<p><i>Drought-evading</i> plants (in common with the deciduous plants of
northern and colder climes which remain dormant while below-freezing
temperatures prevail), meet the heat and drought by reducing the
bodily processes to maintain life only, dropping their leaves, and
remaining in a state of dormancy until temperature and moisture conditions,
suitable to renewed activity, again prevail.</p>
<p>The <i>drought-resisting</i> plants are the bold spirits which take the
worst that the desert has to offer without flinching, or resorting to
evasive tactics. Chief among these are the cacti which store moisture in
their spongy stem or root tissues during periods of rainfall, using it
sparingly during drought. To reduce moisture loss to a minimum, they
have done away with their leaves, the green skin of their stems taking
over the function of foliage. Other plants, such as the Mesquite, develop
deep or widespread root systems that extract every drop of moisture
from a huge area of soil. The majority of the drought-resisters either
cut down their leaf surface to an irreducible minimum, or coat the
leaves with wax or varnish, thus restricting the loss of moisture.</p>
<p>Methods, techniques, devices, or body modifications which desert
plants have developed or evolved to enable them to withstand the
rigors of long-continued drought and heat are legion. Many of them
are known and understood, but it is probable that there are many others
which scientists have not yet discovered.</p>

</div>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Common Names: <b>GIANT CACTUS</b>, (<b>SAGUARO</b>)</dt>
<dt>Arizona desert. (<i>Carnegiea gigantea</i>). Waxy white. May-June.</dt>
<dt>Cactus family. Size: Up to 50 feet tall and 12 tons in weight.</dt></dl>
<p>Largest of the U. S. cacti, this species occurs only in southern and
western Arizona and adjoining northwestern Mexico and sparingly
in extreme southeast California. It is an indicator of the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>This giant is such a spectacular example of desert vegetation that it
is used as a trademark of the desert. It is the state flower of Arizona.
Blossoms unfold at night, remaining open until late the following afternoon,
attracting swarms of insects which in turn attract birds. Fruits
mature in July, resembling small, egg-shaped cucumbers. When ripe,
they burst open revealing a scarlet lining and deep red pulp filled with
tiny black seeds. Fruits are eagerly sought by birds and rodents.</p>
<p>Because of its enormous capacity for storing water in its spongy stem
tissue, the Saguaro (sah-WAR-oh) produces flowers and fruits even during
droughts of long duration. When other foods failed, the Pima and
Papago Indians could depend upon the Saguaro harvest.</p>

<p>Saguaros are believed to live to a maximum age of
200 years, usually succumbing to a necrosis disease transmitted
by the larv&aelig; of a small moth. Grazing cattle
trample out the young plants and much of the desert
occupied by Saguaros is being placed
under cultivation. Both Saguaro
National Monument and Organ Pipe
Cactus National Monument preserve
and protect spectacular stands of
these desert behemoths.</p>

<dl class="undent"><dt>Common Names: <b>NIGHTBLOOMING CEREUS</b>, (<i><b>Reina-de-la-noche</b></i>)</dt>
<dt>Arizona and Texas deserts. (<i>Peniocereus greggi</i>). White. June-July.</dt>
<dt>Cactus family. Size: 2 to 5 feet tall.</dt></dl>
<p>One of the most delicately beautiful of the flowers for which the
desert is famous, &ldquo;Queen of the Night&rdquo; is waxy-white with thread-like
stamens that give it the appearance of wearing a halo. The night on
which the Cereus blooms is eagerly awaited by desert dwellers of long
residence. All of the buds on a single plant, from two to six or seven in
number, may open on the same night or may time their opening over a
period of a week or more, usually in late June or early July, depending
upon the season and other factors.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for nearly all of the plants in one locality to blossom
on the same night. Buds unfold in the early evening, the flowers wilting
permanently soon after sunrise the following morning. Fragrant, with a
heavy, cloying perfume, they attract large numbers of night-flying insects.</p>
<p>The long, slender, fluted, lead-colored stems of the Nightblooming
Cereus are inconspicuous and unattractive. Usually growing upward
from beneath a Creosotebush or other desert shrub, they are partially
supported and almost entirely hidden by the larger plant.</p>
<p>The beet-like root, which serves as a moisture-storage organ, may
weigh from 5 to 85 pounds and is reportedly eaten by desert Indians.
Fruits are podlike, pointed at the ends, and the size of a large pickle.
They turn dull red when mature.</p>

<p>All portions of this coarse, vine-like herb are poisonous, and are used
by some Indians as a narcotic to induce visions.</p>
<p>Seeds are sometimes administered to prevent miscarriage.</p>
<p>The plants with their large, gray-green leaves and showy, white,
sometimes lavender-tinted flowers which open at night and close soon
after contact by rays of the morning sun, are a common and arresting

<dt>Arizona, California, and Texas deserts. (Argemone platyceras). White. Blooms all year.</dt>
<dt>Poppy family. Size: Up to 30 inches in height.</dt></dl>
<p>One of the commonest and most noticeable perennials of the Southwest,
the Pricklypoppy ranges from South Dakota and Wyoming to
Texas, Arizona, southern California, and northern Mexico. A coarse,
prickly plant with large flowers and yellowish sap, it is easily recognized.</p>
<p>It is sometimes facetiously called &ldquo;cowboys&rsquo; fried egg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flowers are normally white with large, tissue-paper petals and yellow
centers. In southern Arizona an occasional plant with pale yellow petals
is found; and in Big Bend National Park, Texas, a form with rose-colored
petals and a deep red center is occasionally encountered.</p>
<p>Plants are drought-resistant, unpalatable to livestock, and may be
found in blossom during any month in the year, although much more
prolific during the spring and summer. When abundant on cattle range,
they are an indication of over-grazing. Seeds are reported to contain a
narcotic more potent than opium.</p>

<dt>Arizona and California deserts. (<i>Hesperocallis undulata</i>). White. March-April.</dt>
<dt>Lily family. Size: Narrow-leafed perennial, 6 inches to 2 feet.</dt></dl>
<p>One of the showiest and most famous of the desert wildflowers,
although limited in distribution to sandy areas below 2,000 feet elevation,
the Desertlily greatly resembles the Easterlily of greenhouse habitat.</p>
<p>In some seasons, the blossoms are abundant and their delicate fragrance
perfumes the surrounding atmosphere. During &ldquo;off&rdquo; seasons, visitors
may scour the desert to find only a very few of the fragile blossoms.</p>
<p>Named &ldquo;Ajo&rdquo; by Spanish explorers because of the large, edible bulb
resembling garlic, the Lily has passed on its name to a mountain range,
a broad valley, and a thriving town in southwestern Arizona where it
grows in profusion. Its range is limited to southwestern Arizona, southeastern
California, and probably northern Sonora.</p>
<p>Papago Indians eat the bulbs which have an onion-like flavor. Bulbs
are difficult to obtain because they grow at a depth of 18 inches to two
feet beneath the surface of the hard-packed desert soil. Flowers remain
open during the day, and propagation is principally by seeds.</p>

<p>Well known and widely grown because of its large clusters of red or

handsomest shrubs found under cultivation in towns and cities of the
desert. Requiring sub-tropical conditions, easily rooted from cuttings,
and rapid in growth, the Oleander thrives in Southwestern desert areas
if supplied with plenty of water. It is used individually and as hedgerows
in ornamental plantings.</p>
<p>Although blossoms may be present at almost any time of year, the
principal flowering season extends from early spring well through the
summer. Both the red-flowered and the white-flowered plants are popular

<dl class="undent"><dt>Common name: <b>DODDER</b></dt>
<dt>Arizona and Texas deserts. (<i>Cuscuta indecora</i>). White. July-August.</dt>
<dt>California desert. (<i>Cuscuta denticulata</i>). Pale yellow. July-August.</dt>
<dt>Convolvulus family. Size: Vine-like, covering host plant.</dt></dl>
<p>Rootless, leafless, and with pale yellow to brownish stems which twine
in vine-like embrace about the host, the parasitic Dodders are immediately
noticeable because of their strange appearance.</p>
<p>Frequently the automobile traveler&rsquo;s attention is arrested by a pale
yellowish blotch in the green of the roadside vegetation. Examination
shows this to be caused by the matted yellowish stems and the white to
pale yellow, fleshy blossoms. These flowers are attractive and often
abundant enough to make a showy display.</p>
<p>Dodder is found widespread throughout the United States and
is often a serious parasitic pest on crops of economic importance.
Desert species are usually found infesting Mesquite, Goldenrod, Aster,
Burrobush, Seepwillow, and Arrowweed. Although certain Dodders show
a preference in choosing hosts (<i>C. denticulata</i> common on Creosotebush),
most of them grow readily upon various plants.</p>

<dl class="undent"><dt>Common Names: <b>JOSHUA-TREE</b>, <b>TREE YUCCA</b>, <b>GIANT JOSHUA</b></dt>
<dt>California desert. (<i>Yucca brevifolia</i>). Green-white. February-April.</dt>
<dt>Lily family. Size: 15 to 35 feet high; spread of 20 feet.</dt></dl>
<p>Because the presence of the grotesque Joshua-tree marks, more
effectively than any other plant, the limits and extent of the Mohave
Desert, this species is worthy of special recognition. This tree Yucca
holds, in the Mohave Desert, similar status to the Saguaro in the Sonoran
Desert. Strangely enough, in west-central Arizona, the Saguaro and
Joshua-tree are found growing together and there the Sonoran and
Mohave Deserts overlap.</p>
<p>And, just as in southern Arizona an area has been set aside as Saguaro
National Monument to preserve and protect that species, so in southern
California we find the Joshua Tree National Monument.</p>
<p>The Joshua-tree is outstanding among the many species of Yucca
because of its short leaves growing in dense bunches or clusters, and
because the plant has a definite trunk with numerous branches forming
a crown. Great forests of these sturdy trees are found in parts of southern
California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and northwestern Arizona
where rainfall averages 8 to 10 inches per year.</p>
<p>Flowers of this Yucca develop as tight clusters of greenish-white buds
at the ends of the branches, but do not open wide as do the flowers of
other Yuccas. Joshua-trees do not bloom every year, the interval apparently
being determined by rainfall and temperature. Birds, a small lizard,
wood rats, and several species of insects are closely associated with the
Joshua-tree, making use of it for food, shelter, or nest-building materials.
Indians use the smallest roots, which are red, for patterns in their baskets.</p>
<p>The name &ldquo;Joshua-tree&rdquo; was given by the Mormons because the tree
seemed to be lifting its arms in supplication as did the Biblical Joshua.</p>

<p>Although, in general, the Broad-leafed Yuccas do not reach tree size,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
the Giant Dagger (<i>Yucca carnerosana</i>) of Big Bend National Park
reaches a height of 20 feet. In dense stands or &ldquo;forests&rdquo; these Yuccas,
with their huge clusters of creamy, wax-like, lightly scented, bell-shaped
flowers produce a never-to-be-forgotten display in blooming season.</p>
<p>The Yucca is the state flower of New Mexico.</p>
<p>Yuccas are often confused by newcomers to the desert with three
other groups of plants: the <i>Agaves</i> (Century Plant), <i>Dasylirion</i> (Sotol)
and <i>Nolinas</i> (Beargrass).</p>
<p>The plate on the opposite page has been devoted to a comparison of
the four groups, and by studying it carefully, the characteristics by
which each may be identified can be determined.</p>
<p>Yucca leaf fibers have long been used by Indians for fabricating rope,
matting, sandals, basketry, and coarse cloth. Indians also ate the buds,
flowers, and emerging flower stalks. The large, pulpy fruits were eaten
raw or roasted, and the seeds ground into meal.</p>
<p>Roots of the Yuccas have saponifying properties and are still gathered
by some tribes and used as soap, especially for washing the hair. Flowers
are browsed by livestock. (See <a href="#Page_22">Narrow-leaf Yuccas</a> and <a href="#Page_18">Joshua-tree</a>).
<i>Yucca baccata</i>, a broad-leaf species found in the Southwest outside of the
desert areas, is discussed in &ldquo;Flowers of the Southwest Mesas.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="jr b">CREAM</p>

<dt>Texas desert: (<i>Nolina erumpens</i>). White-cream. May-June.</dt>
<dt>Lily family. Size: Ragged clumps 4 to 8 feet in diameter and flower stalks up to 8 feet high.</dt></dl>
<p>The <i>Nolinas</i> are sometimes confused with Sotol and the <i>Yuccas</i> and
occasionally with the <i>Agaves</i>. However, the <i>Nolinas</i> resemble huge
clumps of long-bladed grass, whereas Sotol leaves are ribbon-like and
<i>Yucca</i> leaves taper to a sharp point. Flower stalks of the <i>Nolinas</i> are
usually drooping and plume-like, and the numerous flowers are tiny.
The many papery, dry-winged fruits often remain on the stalk until
late autumn.</p>
<p>Beargrass does not grow on the flat mesas or sandy flats as do the
Yuccas, but is confined to exposed locations on rocky slopes above the
3,000-foot elevation. The Parry Nolina of the California Desert is a
larger and more spectacular plant than the species found in the Arizona
and Texas-New Mexico Deserts. Indians
are reported to use the very young
flower stalks for food. Leaves are browsed
by livestock in times of drought, sometimes
with harmful results in the case of
sheep or goats.</p>

<p>At first glance, this plant may readily be mistaken for a Yucca, but
its ribbon-like leaves (which are usually split at the tips instead of sharp-pointed)
and tiny flowers instead of the bell-like blossoms of the Yucca,
are distinguishing characteristics. The round heads of these plants
grow close to the ground with the thick, woody stem beneath the soil.

a broad, curving blade.</p>

<p>When trimmed and polished, they are sold as curios
called &ldquo;desert spoons.&rdquo; In some portions of the desert
near large cities, exploitation of the plants for this purpose
has endangered the species and aroused the ire of
conservationists.</p>
<p>The cabbage-like base, after the leaves are removed,
is split and fed to livestock as an emergency ration during
periods of drought.</p>
<p>The rounded heads of these plants are high in sugar which is dissolved
in the sap of the bud stalk. This sap, when gathered and fermented,
produces a potent beverage called &ldquo;sotol,&rdquo; which is the &ldquo;bootleg&rdquo;
of northern Mexico.</p>

<p>The Narrow-leaf Yuccas are frequently confused with the <i>Agaves</i>
(Century plant), <i>Dasylirion</i> (Sotol), and <i>Nolinas</i> (Beargrass) but may
readily be recognized by the fibers protruding from the margins of the
leaves. To permit comparison and bring out the differences so that the
four groups may be recognized and confusion avoided, sketches of all
four appear on the same plate (<a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a>).</p>
<p>In many grassland areas of western Texas and southern New Mexico,
<i>Y. elata</i> dominates the landscape for miles. This species has been used as
emergency rations for range stock during periods of drought, the chopped
stems being mixed with concentrates such as cottonseed meal. A substitute
for jute has been made from the leaf fibers. Indians eat the young
flower stalks, which grow rapidly and are relatively tender.</p>
<p>In its relationship with a moth of the genus <i>Pronuba</i>, the Yucca
illustrates one of Nature&rsquo;s interesting partnerships. The moth, which
visits the Yucca flowers at night, lays her eggs in the ovary of a flower
where the larvae will feed upon the developing seeds. But to be sure that
the seeds do develop, the moth must place pollen on the stigma of the
flower. Dependent upon the moth for this vital act of pollenization, the
Yucca repays its winged benefactor by sacrificing some of
its developing seeds as food for the moth&rsquo;s larv&aelig;. Fruits
of the Narrow-leaf are dry capsules in contrast to the
fleshy fruits of the Broad-leaf Yuccas.</p>

<p><i>Yucca whipplei</i> is a much smaller plant than <i>Y. elata</i>,
but produces a stouter flower stalk with a great spreading
plume of small, delicate flowers. These graceful plumes

the name &ldquo;Our Lord&rsquo;s Candle.&rdquo; (See Broad-leaf Yucca

white berries is much in demand as a Christmas green. The Mistletoe is
the state flower of Oklahoma.</p>
<p>The species of Mistletoe that parasitize such trees as Ironwood, Mesquite,
and Catclaw have small, scale-like tawny-brown leaves and stems.
The tiny yellow-green flowers which appear in spring are fragrant and
secrete nectar which attracts Honeybees and other insects. The handsome
coral-pink berries are a major food, during the winter months, for
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
Phainopeplas and other birds. The Arizona Verdin often builds its nest
in the protected center of a clump of Mistletoe. Birds are believed to be
instrumental in spreading this parasite from tree to tree.</p>

<p>The numerous thorns, short and curved like a cat&rsquo;s claw, serve readily
to identify this common, often abundant, shrub or small tree.</p>
<p>There are several species, some with large, bright-yellow flowers, but
<i>A. greggi</i> is the most common and occurs throughout all of the deserts
of the Southwest, at elevations below 4,000 feet, often forming thickets
along streams and washes.</p>
<p>Flowers, like pale yellow, fuzzy caterpillars, are one of the important
sources of nectar for honeybees, the trees being alive with insects during
the period of heaviest blooming in April and May.</p>
<p>In mid-August, the light green fruit pods begin to turn reddish and,
if abundant, make a colorful display.</p>
<p>Seeds of the Catclaw were at one time widely used as food by the
Indians of Arizona and Mexican tribes. They were ground into meal and
eaten as mush or cakes.</p>
<p>Catclaw is one of the most heartily disliked plants in the Southwest,
especially by riders and hikers, because of the strong thorns which tear
clothing and lacerate the flesh.</p>

<dt>Pea family. Size: Green-barked tree up to 25 feet high.</dt></dl>
<p>Arizona Paloverdes (meaning green stick) are large shrubs or small
trees abundant along washes in the hotter, drier portions of the Sonoran
Desert. When in blossom in the springtime, they appear as masses of
pale yellow or golden bloom, and are a glorious sight, both as individual
trees and massed as borders along the courses of washes which they
mark with a line of color winding across the desert floor. During the
dry season, they are without leaves, but are readily recognized by the
bark, yellowish green in the case of <i>C. microphyllum</i>; blue green in
<i>C. floridum</i>.</p>
<p>After the petals form, seeds form in bean-like pods which are not
relished by livestock, but are eaten during periods of drought and when
other forage is scarce. Indians ground the seeds into meal.</p>
<p>When the trees are in blossom, they attract myriads of insects, some
of which, including Honeybees, seek the nectar. Wood is soft and the
branches are brittle and easily broken. It is unsuited for fuel as it burns

<p>A troublesome annual vine-like weed naturalized from southern
Europe, the Puncturevine has established itself throughout the Southwest
below 7,000 feet. Although fairly readily controlled by cultivation,
the plant spreads rapidly in sandy, dry wastelands, often taking over
vacant lots in towns, and areas in the desert where it finds sufficient
moisture.</p>
<p>The fruits, which are produced in quantities, are armed with strong
spurs which become embedded in the feet and fur of animals and in
automobile tires. Fruits are also carried by irrigation or flood waters.
Although the spurs are too short to puncture automobile tires, they
make bicycles almost useless in some localities, and are an aggravation
to children who go barefoot&mdash;and to dogs.</p>
<p>Flowers and fruits in various stages of maturity may be found on
this fast-growing plant at almost any time during the summer months.
Botanically, Puncturevine is closely related to the Creosotebush and also
to the Arizona-poppy.</p>

<p>No one could justifiably question the statement that Creosotebush is
the most successful, widespread, and readily recognized desert plant of
the hot, arid regions of North America. It often occurs over wide areas
in such pure stands as to constitute true <i>Larrea</i> plains. Its common companion
is the grayish Burrobush or Bur-sage.</p>
<p>Following winter rains, the Creosotebush may put out a few yellow
blossoms in January, but usually bursts into full flower in April or May, to
be followed in a short time with the equally spectacular fuzzy white seed
balls making the bushes appear to be covered with a light frosting of
snow. After a rain, the plants give off a musty, resinous odor which is the
basis of the Mexican name <i>Hediondilla</i> (freely translated, &ldquo;Little
Stinker&rdquo;). Lac occurs as a resinous incrustation on the branches, and was
used by the Indians for mending pottery, making mosaics, and for fixing
arrow points.</p>
<p>Leaves of the Creosotebush are covered with a &ldquo;varnish&rdquo; which often
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
glistens in the sunlight, and helps reduce evaporative moisture loss,
thereby enabling the plant to resist the desiccating effect of hot, dry winds.</p>

<p>Mesquite (mess-KEET) is one of the commonest and most widespread
of desert trees, often growing in extensive thickets. It occurs at
elevations below 5,000 feet, usually along streams, desert washes, or in
locations where the water table is relatively high, from Kansas to California
and south into Mexico. Roots are reported to penetrate to a depth
of 60 feet with more wood below ground than above. In some parts of
the desert, blowing sand settles around Mesquite clumps forming hummocks
through which rodents tunnel.</p>
<p>The numerous branches are armed with sturdy, straight thorns. In the
spring when covered with bright green leaves and laden with catkin-like
clusters of greenish-yellow flowers, Mesquite is a particularly handsome
shrub or tree. Blossoms are fragrant and attract myriads of insects,
including Honeybees.</p>
<p>During pioneer days, Mesquite wood was of the utmost importance to
settlers as fuel, and was also used extensively in building corrals and in
making furniture and utensils. With the exception of Ironwood, Mesquite
is the best firewood to be found in the desert, giving off a characteristic
aroma and forming a long-lived bed of coals.</p>
<p>Fruits of the Mesquite, which resemble string beans, ripen in autumn
and are eaten by domestic livestock and other animals. They are rich in
sugar and still form a staple food among natives. Indians made wide use
of Mesquite, the fruits often carrying them over periods when their crops
failed. <i>Pinole</i>, a meal made by grinding the long, sweet pods, was served
in many ways. When fermented, it formed a favorite intoxicating drink of
the Pimas. The gum, which exudes through the bark, was eaten as candy,
and was used as a pottery-mending cement, and as a black dye.</p>

<p>Although the Screwbean, so called because of the tight spiral curl
formed by the seed pod, is not as common as Honey Mesquite, it is nearly
as widespread, being found below 4,000 feet from western Texas to
southern Nevada, and southern California to northern Mexico. The
majority of the trees are small and shrubby.</p>
<p>Fruits, in common with those of Honey Mesquite, are used by Indians
and livestock for food. Bark from the roots was used by the Pima Indians
to treat wounds. Where abundant, the wood is used for fence posts, tool
handles, and fuel. Birds, particularly the Crissal Thrasher, make use of
the shreddy bark for nest-lining material.</p>
<p>Where Screwbean and Honey Mesquite grow together, they may be

<p>After winters of particularly heavy precipitation, these small close-growing

<p>They occur in Arizona below 3,600 feet, westward to California,
Lower California, and north to Oregon. A plant of winter and early
springtime, Goldfields takes advantage of winter moisture and cool
spring weather to produce its flowers and mature its seeds. Thus it
escapes the heat and drought of the desert by lying dormant in the seed
stage until the moisture and cool temperatures of the following winter
awaken it.</p>
<p>In common with Goldpoppy and other annuals that mature their
seeds before the summer heat descends upon the desert, Goldfields cannot
correctly be called a &ldquo;desert plant.&rdquo; Actually these are plants of cooler
climes which have found winter conditions in the desert ideal for their
needs and have established themselves.</p>
<p>These plants demonstrate effectively one method, that of escaping
the heat and drought, by which plants have adapted themselves to survival
in the desert. Like the winter tourist, they take advantage of ideal
climatic conditions of winter and spring. Since, unlike the winter tourist,
they cannot return north for the summer, they take the next best course

<p>This low-growing, woolly, annual herb with showy, yellow flowers on
long, solitary stems is one of the commonest bloomers gracing the desert
roadsides and making patches of bright color along otherwise drab and
dry, sandy desert washes. It is particularly noticeable because of its
luxurious crop of flowers and long period of bloom.</p>
<p>At first glance, Desert-marigold may be confused with Crownbeard, to
which it is quite similar in color, size, and habit of growing in groups.
However, the regular, circular shape of Marigold blooms and the considerable
difference in leaf shape make the two readily distinguishable.</p>
<p>In California, Desert-marigold is cultivated for the flower trade.</p>
<p>Fatal poisoning of sheep on over-grazed ranges has been laid at the
door of this plant, although horses crop the flower heads, apparently
without harmful effect. Blossom petals become bleached and papery as
the blossoms age, thus giving the plant in some localities the name
Paperdaisy.</p>
<p>Desert-marigold, of which there are but few species, is common
throughout desert areas of the Southwest from Utah and Nevada to
Lower California, Sonora and Chihuahua.</p>

<p>Many species of Agave are found in various parts of the desert, hence

covering hundreds of square miles in Texas, New Mexico, and
northern Mexico, is an indicator of the Chihuahuan Desert, holding the
position in that desert which the Saguaro does in the Sonoran desert and
the Joashua-tree in the Mohave Desert.</p>

<p>Agave plants require a number of years to store sufficient plant foods
for the production of the huge flower stalk which grows
with amazing rapidity to produce the many flowers and
seeds, after which the plant dies. This long pre-blossom
period of a dozen to 15 or more years is the basis for the
name &ldquo;Centuryplant.&rdquo; If the young flower stalk is cut off,
the sweet sap may be collected and fermented to form
highly intoxicating beverages, some of which are distilled
commercially. Among these are mescal, pulque (POOL-kay),
and tequila (tay-KEEL-ah). Indians cut the young
bud stalks, and roast them in rock-lined pits.</p>

<p>One of the few flower families restricted to the desert, the unique
Ocotillo (oh-koh-TEE-oh) with its long, unbranching stems is found on
rocky hillsides below 5,000 feet from western Texas to southern California
and south into Mexico. It is one of the commonest, queerest, and most
spectacular of desert plants, especially when the tips of its long, slender
stems seem afire with dense clusters of bright red blossoms. Following
rains, leaves clothe the thorny stems with green, but after the soil becomes
dry, the leaves turn brown and fall. The heavily thorned stems are covered
with green bark which takes over the functions of leaves during
periods of drought. The plant thus becomes semi-dormant during hot dry

<dt>Tamarix family. Size: Shrubs to trees up to 15-20 feet high.</dt></dl>
<p>Purists could object to inclusion of the Saltcedar in this booklet
because it is not native. However, due to a number of importations (eight
species being introduced by the Department of Agriculture between 1899
and 1915) and to its ability to spread rapidly under suitable conditions,
Saltcedar is now widespread throughout the Southwest.</p>
<p>It grows as a graceful shrub or small tree with drooping branches covered
with small, scale-like leaves and is abundant in moist locations below
5,000 feet. It prefers a hot climate, low humidity, and saline soils. In
river bottoms, it often forms dense thickets which require immense quantities
of water, hence rob the few desert streams of a high percentage of
their moisture.</p>
<p>Honeybees obtain nectar from the blossoms, which are particularly
noticeable in the spring and early summer, as they completely cover the
branches which appear as light pink, drooping plumes. The thickets are
valuable as wind breaks and in erosion control, and once established, are
very difficult to control and because of the deep shade cast by their dense
growth and the heavy feeding of the shallow roots, they prevent cropping.</p>
<p>The name Tamarisk is often confused with the name of the Larch
or Tamarack tree. There is little similarity except in the name.</p>
<p>The larger <i>Tamarix aphylla</i> is similar in appearance but much larger
and suitable for cultivation as a shade and decorative tree. It is subject to
winterkill, but does not have the bad habit of spreading, characteristic of
<i>T. pentandra</i>.</p>

<p>Representatives of the Phlox genus are found from the hot desert lowlands

limited in their range to the desert areas of the Southwest, and it is in
these that we are interested here. The plants sometimes present a mass
of heavy bloom twice yearly: heaviest in the spring, and again following
the summer rains. Several of the native species have been brought under
cultivation, particularly <i>P. tenuifolia</i>, in desert gardens, as it grows
naturally in a brushy habitat similar to that formed by the shrubs planted
around a house. Other forms grow as low, creeping mats forming fragrant,
colorful floral carpets.</p>

<dt>Bignonia family. Size: Shrubby tree, 6 to 15 feet high.</dt></dl>
<p>Although a close relative of the Catalpa, the willow-like foliage of
this small tree has given it the name Desertwillow. A small and inconspicuous
part of the desert vegetation when not in flower, unnoticed
among the heavier growth of trees and shrubs that crowd the banks of
desert washes, the tree&rsquo;s beautiful orchid-like flowers of white to lavender
mottled with dots and splotches of brown and purple bring exclamations
of delight from persons viewing them for the first time. Because of the
beauty of the tree when in bloom, it is sometimes cultivated as an
ornamental.</p>
<p>Leaves are rarely browsed by livestock, and the durable, black-barked
wood is used for fenceposts. In Mexico, a tea made by steeping the dried
flowers is considered to be of medicinal value. By early autumn, the violet-scented
flowers which appear after summer rains are replaced by the
long, slender seed pods which remain dangling from the branches and
serve to identify the tree long after the flowers are gone.</p>
<p>Although Desertwillows are never found in pure stands, growing
singly and rather infrequently among other trees and shrubs lining desert
washes, the species is quite common below 4,000 feet across the entire
desert from western Texas to southern Nevada, southern California and

<p>These two spectacular desert giants with their clumps of erect
branches are sufficiently similar to be readily confused at first glance.
However, the stems of the Organpipe (<i>L. thurberi</i>) are longer and contain
more but much smaller ridges than do the stems of the Sinita or
&ldquo;Whisker cactus.&rdquo; The name &ldquo;Sinita&rdquo; (meaning old age) refers to the
long, gray, hair-like spines covering the upper ends of the Sinita stems.</p>
<p>Both species are night-blooming, the flowers, which appear along the
sides and at the tips of the stems, closing soon after sunrise the following

<dt>Cactus family. Size: Cucumber-shaped and 3 to 10 inches high.</dt></dl>
<p>Unlike blossoms of many of the Cacti, flowers of the little
<i>Mammallarias</i> often last for several days. Blossoms are pink or lavender,
occasionally yellow, while the fruits are finger- or club-shaped and red.
Being small and forming low clumps, or with single pincushion-like
stems, they often escape attention except when glorified with bright, comparatively
large flowers, which often form a crown around the top of the
plant. The long spines are curved at the tips giving the plant the appearance
of being covered with unbarbed fishhooks.</p>
<p>The Pincushion cacti, of which there are a number of species

<p>So sensitive is this plant to moisture, that it may burst into blossom
within a few hours after a soaking rain, this phenomenon giving rise to
the local belief that the plant actually blossoms before the rain, thereby

<p>Believed to have been introduced from the Mediterranean countries

<p>Although the blossoms are not large nor sufficiently numerous to make
a colorful display, they are attractive and welcome, as they are among
the first spring flowers to put in an appearance. &ldquo;Tails&rdquo; of the fruits are
long and slender, somewhat resembling a Heron&rsquo;s bill, and upon maturity
twist into a tight spiral when dry. Upon becoming moist, they uncoil,
driving the sharp-tipped seeds into the soil. Seeds are gathered and stored

<p>Ironwood is one of the desert&rsquo;s most beautiful trees, being particularly
colorful when the new, dark-green leaves and violet, wisteria-like flowers
give it a lavender glow in late May or early June. Since the tree survives
only in warm locations, it has for years served as a guide to citrus
growers in selecting sites for orange, lemon, or grapefruit plantings.</p>
<p>Foliage of the Ironwood is dense and evergreen, and the wood is very
heavy and so hard that it cannot be worked with ordinary tools. When
thoroughly dry, it makes high-quality firewood, and as a result it has
been cut and removed over much of the desert, hence mature trees are
becoming relatively scarce. Indians used the wood for arrow points and
as tool handles.</p>
<p>Ironwood trees grow along desert washes, often in company with
Mesquite and Paloverde. Blossoms are much more numerous in some years
than in others. Although the trees, when in bloom, make a spectacular
showing, they are very difficult to capture on color film, and photographs
that do them justice are rare. Seeds, which mature late in the summer,
are roasted and eaten by desert Indians who prize them for their peanut-like
flavor. They are eaten also by various desert animals.</p>
<p>In Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and in some other parts

deep purple, the Lupines are usually considered as blue flowers.</p>
<p>The name &ldquo;Lupine&rdquo; comes from the Latin word meaning wolf and
was applied to these plants because they were believed to rob the soil of
its fertility. Actually, they prefer the poorer, sandy soils and, by fixing in
the soil nitrogen that they, in common with other plants of the pea family,

pale purple in the corolla throat, open as the spike uncoils, perfuming the
desert air with their fragrance. The name &ldquo;Pusley&rdquo; which is applied to
this plant in some localities is possibly a corruption of &ldquo;Purslane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pima Indians are reported to powder the dried roots of these plants,
applying the dust to wounds or sores. The name &ldquo;Wild-heliotrope&rdquo; is also
applied to another desert flower, <i>Phacelia crenulata</i> (<a href="#Page_77">which see</a>), causing

<p>Seldom found above 3,000 feet elevation, the rank-smelling Arrowweed
forms dense, willow-like thickets in stream beds and in moist, saline
soils. It is common in moist locations from Texas to southern Utah and
south into California and Mexico; usually in pure, dense stands.</p>
<p>The green foliage gives off an agreeable odor, but when the plant dries
this becomes rank and unpleasant, clinging to the plant long after it has
been cut. This odor is often a characteristic of native dwellings where
Arrowweed has been used as a ceiling mat above the rafters.</p>
<p>Arrowweed is browsed by deer, and sometimes by horses and cattle.
The straight stems were used by Indians in making arrowshafts, and are
still important as a construction material in the walls and roofs of mud
huts. The stems are used, also, by desert Indians in basketmaking, and
in fabricating storage bins and animal cages. From the foliage of the
stem tips, Pima Indians brewed a tea which they used as an eye wash.</p>
<p>The flowers are reported to furnish considerable nectar gathered by
Honeybees. The blossoms are inconspicuous and develop into tawny-tufted

white-barked shrub, the several species of which are very common on the
dry plains and mesas up to 3,000 feet. The flowers are small, without
petals, and colorless inasmuch as they are wind-pollenated and do not
need to attract insects.</p>
<p>It is classed by A. A. Nichol as one of the major plants of the Paloverde-Bur-sage-Cacti
plant association, one of the three plant communities
of the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>Bur-sage is one of the favorite foods of burros and sheep, and is said
to be preferred also by horses.</p>

<p>Seepweed, which is usually an indicator of alkaline soil, is browsed to
some extent by cattle when other feed is scarce. The young plants are
used for greens by the Pimas and other desert Indians, sometimes eaten
with cactus fruits. <i>Pinole</i> was made by roasting the seeds. Coahuila Indians
extracted from the plants a black dye which they used in art work.</p>
<p>Flowers of the Seepweed are small, greenish, and without petals.
Since the pollen is carried by the wind, color to attract insects to the
flowers is not necessary. Because of its tolerance for somewhat salty or
alkaline soils, Seepweed thrives along the margins of dry lakes and on salt
flats where moisture is near the surface. On the desert of southern California
it is often associated with Mesquite and Quailbrush, the sooty-green
to brown plants standing out in sharp contrast.</p>
<p>Because it is so common in moist locations throughout the Southwest,
and sufficiently unusual in appearance to arouse curiosity as to its identity,
Seepweed is included in this publication regardless of the fact that its
flowers are small and inconspicuous.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
